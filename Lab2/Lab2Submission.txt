Instructions: 
(1) run usbwebserver.exe on an windows machine
(2) click localhost in window that opens up
(3) explore vulnerabilities detailed below

For Lab 2, we were instructed to create an application with some 
vulnerabilities. To make it easy to have vulnerabilities we decided 
to use a WAMP (windows, Apache, MySql, PHP) server without any security. 

Our application is supposed to be a salary management service that allows
a supervisor to view the salaries of current employees and conduct a simple
query on a database of employees. Because no form/db security was placed in
the application, it is relatively simple to carry out CSRF or SQL-injection 
attacks. A malicious user could use SQL-injections to potentially edit the 
database or just drop the entire database among many other malicious actions. 
This attack can be carried out by creating a creative SQL expression and 
entering it into the form. A malicious user could also carry out CSRF attacks 
by analyzing the urls generated on submit of the form and editing them to 
access otherwise unaccessible information.

In the future we plan to switch from a WAMP server to the Django framework as 
it makes it easier to implement security.
